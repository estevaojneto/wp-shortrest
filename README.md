# ShortRest - The Shortcode REST API Plugin

***NOTE: This is a very proof-of-concept project in its early stages and should not be used in a Production environment. Feel free to contribute!***

You no longer have to write code to consume an API's contents and put it in your site!

1) Find an API you'd like to consume, like https://catfact.ninja/fact for example:

2) Create a new "ShortRest Request":

3) Paste in the shortcode with the ID of the Request and the field you'd like to see in the frontend:

4) Ta-da!
